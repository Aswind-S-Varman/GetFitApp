# GetFitApp

**Introduction:**

GetFitApp is a versatile web application designed to enhance the fitness experience for users across various platforms, including both mobile and desktop. Our innovative approach focuses on providing users with comprehensive information about exercises, training regimes, and effective session tracking for individuals with or without trainers. Users can input their details, and the app will tailor a suitable training regime for them. For trainers and trainees, the app efficiently tracks sessions and sends reminders for scheduled workouts. Additionally, it monitors essential metrics like height, weight, and body fat to evaluate gym performance over time.

**Features:**

- **Personalized Training Regimes:** Input your details, and GetFitApp will generate a personalized training regime based on your fitness goals.

- **Session Tracking:** Seamlessly keep track of your gym sessions, ensuring you stay consistent with your fitness routine.

- **Trainer-Trainee Collaboration:** For users with trainers, the app facilitates efficient collaboration by tracking sessions and sending timely reminders.

- **Metric Monitoring:** Track essential metrics like height, weight, and body fat periodically to evaluate your progress.
